## About Me:
I am a PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My advisor is [Jordan Ellenberg](http://www.math.wisc.edu/~ellenber/).

Currently I am a visitor in [Justin Solomon](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon/)'s lab at MIT/CSAIL. I am working with his group to analyze statistical techniques [currently being used](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.03783) to create evidence of Gerrymandering. I also collaborate with members of [MGGG](https://mggg.org/).

## Stack Exchange:

I believe that doing science is a network activity. If the knowledge I need to advance my research goals exists is basic knowledge to some experts that I can be connected to through stack exchange, then it is my responsibility to put aside my ego and ask for help. Overall this means that I can advance more quickly towards more interesting questions.
