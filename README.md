## About Me:
<!---  ![Photo](https://github.com/LorenzoNajt/LorenzoNajt.github.io/blob/master/CoffeeGood.jpg)--->

I am a PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My advisor is [Jordan Ellenberg](http://www.math.wisc.edu/~ellenber/).

Jan 2018 - August 2019 I was a visitor in [Justin Solomon](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon/)'s lab at MIT/CSAIL. I am working with his group to analyze statistical techniques currently being used to create evidence of Gerrymandering. I also collaborate with members of [MGGG](https://mggg.org/).
